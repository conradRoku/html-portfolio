<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Im a 22 year old cook living in santa monica. I just injured my foot causing permanent damage.
I'am unable to be a cook as a result and am now getting into web development. I learn remarkable fast and able too adapt to any situation.
I really enjoy solving all the problems that programming has to offer. Its kind of like a puzzel. </p>
